Testing & Validation
Comprehensive testing to verify security boundaries.
Connectivity Tests
Test 1: VLAN 20 (Home) Connectivity
From device on Home VLAN (192.168.20.x):
bash# Test gateway
ping 192.168.20.1
# Should succeed

# Test Internet
ping 8.8.8.8
# Should succeed

# Test DNS
nslookup google.com
# Should resolve

# Test Internal VLAN access
ping 192.168.40.1
# Should succeed

# Test HTTPS to Internal (if service running)
curl -k https://192.168.40.10
# Should connect
Test 2: VLAN 30 (Guest) Isolation
From device on Guest VLAN (192.168.30.x):
bash# Test Internet
ping 8.8.8.8
# Should succeed

# Test DNS
nslookup google.com
# Should resolve

# Attempt to access Home VLAN
ping 192.168.20.1
# Should FAIL (timeout or filtered)

# Attempt to access Internal VLAN
ping 192.168.40.1
# Should FAIL (blocked by firewall)

# Attempt to SSH to Internal
ssh user@192.168.40.10
# Should FAIL (connection refused or timeout)
Expected Result: Guest devices have Internet only, no LAN access.
Test 3: VLAN 40 (Internal) Security
From device on Internal VLAN (192.168.40.x):
bash# Test Internet access
ping 8.8.8.8
# Should succeed (for updates)

# Test access FROM Home VLAN
# From Home device:
ssh user@192.168.40.10
# Should succeed

# Test access FROM Guest VLAN
# From Guest device:
ssh user@192.168.40.10
# Should FAIL (blocked)
Test 4: VLAN 50 (IoT) Isolation
From device on IoT VLAN (192.168.50.x):
bash# Test Internet
ping 8.8.8.8
# Should succeed

# Attempt Internal access
ping 192.168.40.1
# Should FAIL

# Attempt Home access
ping 192.168.20.1
# Should FAIL
DNS Testing
Verify Pi-hole Integration:
bash# From any VLAN
nslookup doubleclick.net
# Should show blocked/NXDOMAIN if Pi-hole blocking

# Check DNS server in use
nslookup google.com
# Server line should show Pi-hole (192.168.40.2)
```

### Firewall Log Review

Navigate to: **Status > System Logs > Firewall**

**Look for:**
- ✅ Allowed connections from Home → Internal
- ❌ Blocked attempts from Guest → RFC1918
- ❌ Blocked attempts from IoT → RFC1918

**Filter examples:**
```
Interface: GUEST
Action: block
Should show blocked RFC1918 attempts.
DHCP Lease Verification
Navigate to: Status > DHCP Leases
Verify devices are getting IPs in correct ranges:

Home devices: 192.168.20.100-199
Guest devices: 192.168.30.100-199
Internal devices: 192.168.40.100-199
IoT devices: 192.168.50.100-199

Performance Baseline
Measure throughput:
bash# From Home device to Internet
speedtest-cli
# or visit fast.com

# Document baseline for future comparison
```

**Check resource usage:**

Navigate to: **Status > Dashboard**
- CPU usage should be <20% idle
- Memory usage noted
- Traffic graphs baseline
